## Development cycle

1. Before writing any code, come up with an extremely good plan, review the plan, and then ask the user for permission to execute the plan.
2. Never try to start a dev server or curl a local endpoint.
3. Always use bun as your preferred package manager.
4. NEVER run the app on your own via bun dev, bun run dev, etc.
5. NEVER attempt to install any new packages on your own.
